This is my very first attempt at a website and coding with html. It took me much longer than I anticipated because I got caught up in pushing myself to add to the page and make it look better. It was difficult to do this with no live teaching but I think it also taught me how to be independent and resourceful in order to succeed in the real world. I feel like I also learned from my mistakes and it actually helped me to retain the info because I had to work for it. Google happens a lot and I have learned several sites that have been especially helpful. My hope is that by the end of the entire course, I will have started to repeat certain actions and syntax until it becomes habit. I mean, is this how everybody starts out?
